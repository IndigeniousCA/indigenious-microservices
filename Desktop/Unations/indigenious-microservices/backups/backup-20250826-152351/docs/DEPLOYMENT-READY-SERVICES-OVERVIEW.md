## ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKER: Agent Swarm Implementation Required

**Before deployment, MUST implement agent swarm to populate business directory:**

1. **Build Agent Monitoring Service**
   - Service: indigenious-agent-monitoring-service (currently EMPTY)
   - Create agent orchestrator for concurrent data collection
   - Implement web scrapers, API collectors, enrichment agents
   
2. **Data Sources to Integrate:**
   - Government of Canada Business Registry API
   - Provincial business registries  
   - CCAB (Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business) directory
   - Indigenous Works database
   - Statistics Canada business data
   
3. **Implementation Timeline:**
   - Day 1: Build agent orchestrator infrastructure
   - Day 2: Implement data collection agents
   - Day 3: Run population (150K businesses)
   
Without this, the platform has NO businesses to match with RFQs = DOA (Dead on Arrival)
