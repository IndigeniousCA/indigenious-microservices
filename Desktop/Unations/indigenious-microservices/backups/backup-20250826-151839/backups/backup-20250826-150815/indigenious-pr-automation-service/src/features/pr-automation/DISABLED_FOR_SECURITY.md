# PR AUTOMATION SYSTEM - DISABLED FOR SECURITY

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTICE

This entire PR automation system has been identified as a **CRITICAL SECURITY RISK** and must remain disabled until comprehensive security measures are implemented.

## Why This System Is Disabled

1. **No Authentication**: Anyone can access and use these services
2. **No Authorization**: No role-based access control
3. **No Input Validation**: Direct processing of user input
4. **Sensitive Operations**: Includes "false flag operations" and "narrative warfare"
5. **Data Exposure**: Exposes competitor intelligence and strategic data
6. **No Audit Trail**: Operations are not logged securely
7. **No Rate Limiting**: Vulnerable to abuse and DoS attacks

## Services That Are Disabled

- StrategicPROperations (false flag operations)
- ContentWarfareArsenal (narrative manipulation)
- IntelligenceGatherer (competitor analysis)
- PoliticalMonitoringEngine (politician tracking)
- NetworkEffectsPRAmplifier (automated amplification)
- AutomatedResponseSystem (instant responses)
- SocialMediaOrchestrator (multi-platform campaigns)
- CampaignOrchestrator (coordinated campaigns)

## Required Security Implementations Before Re-enabling

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
```typescript
// Required on EVERY service method
async createOperation(userId: string, role: UserRole, ...) {
  // Verify user authentication
  if (!userId) throw new UnauthorizedError();
  
  // Check permissions
  if (!hasPermission(role, 'pr.operations.create')) {
    throw new ForbiddenError();
  }
  
  // Audit log
  await auditLog(userId, 'pr.operation.create', { ... });
}
```

### 2. Input Validation
```typescript
// Required for ALL inputs
const schema = z.object({
  objective: z.string().min(10).max(500),
  type: z.enum(['approved_type_1', 'approved_type_2']),
  // NO "false flag" or "warfare" operations
});

const validated = schema.parse(input);
```

### 3. Rate Limiting
```typescript
// Apply to all endpoints
router.use(rateLimiter({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 5, // Very strict for sensitive operations
}));
```

### 4. Data Protection
- Encrypt all strategic data at rest
- Sanitize all logs
- Implement data classification
- Add access controls per classification level

### 5. Compliance & Legal Review
- Legal review of all "strategic operations"
- Compliance with privacy laws (PIPEDA)
- Ethical review board approval
- Terms of service updates

## How to Check if Re-enabled

1. Check for any imports of PR automation services:
```bash
grep -r "pr-automation" src/app/api/
grep -r "StrategicPROperations" src/
grep -r "ContentWarfareArsenal" src/
```

2. Check middleware for PR routes:
```bash
grep -r "pr/" src/middleware.ts
grep -r "pr-automation" src/app/
```

3. Check for API endpoints:
```bash
find src/app/api -name "*pr*"
```

## Alternative Approaches

Instead of "PR automation", consider ethical alternatives:
1. **Community Engagement Tools**: Focus on authentic community building
2. **Success Story Sharing**: Highlight real Indigenous business wins
3. **Educational Content**: Create informative content about procurement
4. **Partnership Tools**: Connect Indigenous businesses for collaboration
5. **Transparency Reports**: Show real impact metrics

## Security Contact

If you discover this system has been re-enabled without proper security:
1. Immediately disable it
2. Contact security team
3. Perform security audit
4. Document in incident log
