## üîç MONITORING & MANAGEMENT

### Daily Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check service health
./deploy-aws/scripts/health-check.sh

# View today's costs
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \
  --time-period Start=$(date +%Y-%m-%d),End=$(date +%Y-%m-%d) \
  --granularity DAILY \
  --metrics "UnblendedCost" \
  --query 'ResultsByTime[0].Total.UnblendedCost.Amount' \
  --output text

# Check running services
aws ecs list-services --cluster indigenous-production

# View recent logs
aws logs tail /ecs/indigenious-gateway-service --follow
```

### Cost Control Commands

```bash
# Stop all Tier 4 services (save $180/month)
./deploy-aws-complete.sh --tier 4 --action stop

# Use spot instances for non-critical services
./deploy-aws-complete.sh --enable-spot-tier 3,4

# Scale down for weekends
./deploy-aws-complete.sh --schedule weekend-minimal
```

### Scaling Commands

```bash
# Scale up specific service
aws ecs update-service \
  --cluster indigenous-production \
  --service indigenious-web-frontend \
  --desired-count 3

# Deploy additional services
