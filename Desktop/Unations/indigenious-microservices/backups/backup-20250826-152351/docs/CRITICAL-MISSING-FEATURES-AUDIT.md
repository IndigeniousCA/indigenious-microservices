---

## üö® BRANCHES WITH UNIQUE FEATURES

### Critical Branches Not Merged:
1. **swarm-orchestrator-qa** - Business Hunter Swarm
2. **feature/business-hunter-microservice** - Canadian Verification + Tax Debt
3. **standalone-microservices** - AWS GovCloud deployment
4. **feature/security-encryption** - Advanced encryption features
5. **feature/database-performance** - Performance optimizations
6. **aws-deployment** - AWS-specific configurations

---

## üî• IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### Priority 1: Launch Blockers (Must Have by Sept 30)
1. **Migrate Business Hunter Swarm** - Without this, no businesses in directory
2. **Migrate Canadian Verification** - Required for business legitimacy
3. **Merge AWS deployment configs** - Need this to deploy

### Priority 2: Government Requirements
4. **Bill C-5 Compliance** - Federal requirement
5. **Security features** - From security branches
6. **Blockchain audit trail** - For transparency

### Priority 3: Enhanced Features
7. **Voice interface** - Accessibility
8. **Advanced analytics** - Business intelligence
9. **Strategic investments** - Growth features

---

## üí° RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **STOP new feature development**
2. **Audit all branches for missing critical code**
3. **Create migration checklist from monolith branches**
4. **Merge critical branches to main**
5. **Re-run migration scripts with ALL features**

### Migration Strategy:
```bash
# 1. Switch to each branch and identify unique features
git checkout feature/business-hunter-microservice
git diff main --name-only | grep -E "^src/"

# 2. Copy missing features to microservices
cp -r src/features/[missing-feature] ../microservices/[appropriate-service]/

# 3. Update import paths and dependencies
# 4. Test each migrated feature
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RISK ASSESSMENT

**Current Risk Level: CRITICAL**

- **Launch Date:** September 30, 2025
- **Days Remaining:** ~35 days
- **Migration Completion:** ~60%
- **Risk of Failure:** HIGH without immediate action

**If we don't migrate these features:**
- Business directory will be empty (Business Hunter)
- Can't verify businesses (Canadian Verification)
- Can't ensure compliance (Bill C-5, Security)
- Can't deploy to government cloud (AWS GovCloud)
- Platform will be missing core functionality

---

## üìù AUDIT METHODOLOGY

1. Compared monolith branches with microservices
2. Analyzed 85 feature directories in monolith
3. Checked migration status of each feature
4. Reviewed commit history on feature branches
5. Identified unique implementations not in main

---

**Conclusion:** The migration captured the visible features but missed critical systems on feature branches. This is a common problem in complex migrations. Immediate action required to avoid launch failure.
