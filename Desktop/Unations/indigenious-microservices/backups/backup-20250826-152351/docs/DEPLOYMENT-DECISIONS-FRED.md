### 9. üîÑ BACKUP STRATEGY: RTO/RPO Explained

**Definitions:**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** How long can you be down?
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** How much data can you lose?

| Scenario | RPO | RTO | Implementation | Cost/Month |
|----------|-----|-----|----------------|------------|
| **Testing Phase** | 24 hours | 4 hours | Daily backups, manual restore | $10 |
| **Launch (Recommended)** | 1 hour | 30 minutes | Hourly snapshots, automated restore | $50 |
| **Future Growth** | 5 minutes | 5 minutes | Multi-region, real-time replication | $500+ |

**Recommended Launch Configuration:**
```yaml
backup_strategy:
  database:
    automated_backups: true
    backup_window: "03:00-04:00 UTC"
    retention_period: 7 days
    point_in_time_recovery: true
    snapshot_frequency: hourly
    
  s3_documents:
    versioning: enabled
    cross_region_replication: false  # Enable later
    lifecycle_policy:
      transition_to_glacier: 90 days
      
  application_state:
    redis_snapshots: daily
    retention: 3 days
    
  disaster_recovery:
    runbook_documented: true
    restore_tested_monthly: true
    backup_monitoring: CloudWatch alarms
```

**Testing Phase Costs:**
- Aurora automated backups: FREE (included)
- S3 versioning: $5/month
- Manual snapshots: $5/month
- **Total: $10/month**

### 10. ‚öñÔ∏è COST vs PERFORMANCE: Balanced Approach

**Strategy: "Frugal but Functional"**

| Component | Testing Config | Savings | Impact on Performance |
|-----------|---------------|---------|---------------------|
| **Compute** | | | |
| Use Spot Instances | 70% Spot / 30% On-demand | 60% | Occasional instance replacements |
| Right-sizing | Start with t3.micro/small | 50% | May need to scale up |
| Business hours only | 8am-8pm for Tier 4 | 50% | No 24/7 availability |
| **Database** | | | |
| Aurora Serverless v2 | 0.5 ACU minimum | 70% | Slight cold start delay |
| Single AZ initially | No read replicas | 50% | No HA during testing |
| **Network** | | | |
| Single NAT Gateway | No HA | 50% | Single point of failure |
| CloudFront caching | Aggressive caching | 40% | Slight content delays |
| **Storage** | | | |
| S3 Intelligent Tiering | Automatic archival | 30% | Retrieval delays for old files |
| EBS gp3 vs io2 | General purpose SSD | 60% | Lower IOPS |

**Performance Thresholds to Maintain:**
- API Response: < 500ms p95
- Page Load: < 3 seconds
- Database queries: < 100ms p95
- Availability: 99.5% (allows 3.5 hours downtime/month)

## üí° MONEY-SAVING TIPS FOR TESTING

1. **Use AWS Free Tier:**
   - 750 hours t3.micro EC2
   - 20GB EBS storage
   - 1 million Lambda requests
   - 5GB S3 storage

2. **Set up Budget Alerts:**
```bash
# Create $500 budget with alerts at 50%, 80%, 100%
aws budgets create-budget \
  --account-id $ACCOUNT_ID \
  --budget BudgetName=TestingBudget,BudgetLimit={Amount=500,Unit=USD} \
  --notifications-with-subscribers ...
```

3. **Auto-shutdown Non-Production:**
```python
# Lambda to stop services at 8pm
import boto3
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ecs = boto3.client('ecs')
    for service in TIER_4_SERVICES:
        ecs.update_service(
            cluster='indigenous-testing',
            service=service,
            desiredCount=0
        )
```

4. **Use Savings Plans After 3 Months:**
   - Commit to $200/month
   - Save additional 20-30%

## üìã DECISION SUMMARY

| Decision | Choice | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Budget | Minimal testing | $500-800 | Scale after validation |
| Region | ca-central-1 | - | Single region for now |
| Compliance | SOC2 Type II | +$115 | Phased implementation |
| Scaling | 1k-5k users | - | Auto-scaling configured |
| Tier 4 Services | 14 priority | +$180 | Deploy on-demand |
| Monitoring | CloudWatch | $20 | Native AWS solution |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | FREE | Already integrated |
| Secrets | SSM + Secrets Manager | $8 | Hybrid approach |
| Backup | 1hr RPO, 30min RTO | $50 | Automated recovery |
| Optimization | Cost-focused | -60% | Spot instances, scheduling |

**TOTAL ESTIMATED MONTHLY COST: $450-650** ‚úÖ

This is 70% less than full production deployment while maintaining functionality!
