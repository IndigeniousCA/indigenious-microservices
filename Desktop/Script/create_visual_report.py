That's {not_found/total*100:.0f}% PHANTOM BUSINESSES

If this rate holds across all 4,095 Indigenous businesses:
→ {int(4095 * (not_found/total))} phantom businesses
→ ${int(4095 * (not_found/total)) * 300000:,.0f} in fraud

THE SOLUTION EXISTS:
✓ 634 Indigenous verification agents (one per community)
