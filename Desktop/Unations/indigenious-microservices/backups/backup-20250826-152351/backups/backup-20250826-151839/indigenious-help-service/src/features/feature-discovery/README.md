# Feature Discovery UI

An intelligent feature discovery system that helps users discover platform capabilities through AI-powered recommendations, gamification, and personalized learning paths.

## Overview

The Feature Discovery UI analyzes user behavior, goals, and context to provide personalized feature recommendations. It includes:

- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Smart feature suggestions based on user behavior and goals
- **Interactive Feature Gallery**: Browsable catalog with filtering and search
- **Personalized Discovery Paths**: Guided journeys through relevant features

- **Success Stories**: Real user testimonials and impact metrics

## Components

### Core Components

- **`FeatureDiscoveryDashboard`** - Main dashboard with tabs and overview
- **`FeatureGallery`** - Interactive gallery of all features with filtering
- **`FeatureCard`** - Individual feature display component
- **`FeatureSpotlight`** - Modal with detailed feature information
- **`DiscoveryPath`** - Guided learning path through recommended features
- **`GamificationPanel`** - Achievements, badges, and progress tracking

### Services

- **`FeatureDiscoveryService`** - Core business logic for recommendations and analytics

### Types

## Features

### AI-Powered Recommendations

The system analyzes:
- User's current feature usage patterns
- Workflow context and recent actions
- Goals and experience level
- Behavioral indicators (exploration rate, help-seeking)

Recommendation algorithm considers:
- Gap filling (features that solve current problems)
- Workflow enhancement (features that improve existing processes)
- Efficiency boosts (time-saving automation)
- Trend-based suggestions (features similar users love)

### Gamification System

- **Points**: Earned for feature interactions (view: 5, trial: 50, adopt: 100)
- **Levels**: Based on total points (Level = points รท 100)
- **Achievements**: Unlocked for specific behaviors
- **Badges**: Visual rewards for milestones
- **Streaks**: Daily engagement tracking
- **Challenges**: Weekly goals for feature exploration

### Feature Categories

1. **AI-Powered** - Intelligent automation features
2. **Partnerships** - Business relationship tools
3. **Compliance** - Regulatory and policy tools
4. **Visualization** - Data presentation and analysis

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import { FeatureDiscoveryDashboard } from '@/features/feature-discovery/components'

function MyComponent() {
  const userProfile = {
    id: 'user-123',
    type: 'indigenous_business',
    experience: 'intermediate',
    role: 'Business Development Manager',
    goals: ['Find more opportunities', 'Improve efficiency'],
    preferences: {
      showHints: true,

      emailNotifications: true,
      frequency: 'medium',
      categories: ['ai-powered', 'partnerships']
    }
  }

  return <FeatureDiscoveryDashboard userProfile={userProfile} />
}
```

### Individual Components

```tsx
import { FeatureGallery, FeatureCard } from '@/features/feature-discovery/components'

// Feature gallery with filtering
<FeatureGallery 
  userProfile={userProfile}
  onFeatureInteraction={(featureId, action) => {
    console.log(`User ${action} feature ${featureId}`)
  }}
/>

// Individual feature card
<FeatureCard
  feature={feature}
  recommendation={recommendation}
  onAction={(featureId, action) => handleAction(featureId, action)}
  variant="card"
/>
```
