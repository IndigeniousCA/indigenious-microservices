## Breakpoint System

### Standard Breakpoints
```scss
$breakpoints: (
  mobile: 320px,    // Small phones
  phablet: 480px,   // Large phones
  tablet: 768px,    // Tablets
  desktop: 1024px,  // Small desktops
  wide: 1440px,     // Large screens
  ultra: 1920px     // Ultra-wide displays
);
```

### Custom Breakpoints for Indigenous Communities
```scss
$community-breakpoints: (
  basic-phone: 240px,     // Basic smartphones
  satellite-tablet: 600px, // Satellite internet tablets
  community-center: 1280px // Community center displays
);
```

## Touch Optimization

### Touch Targets
- Minimum 44px touch targets (Apple guidelines)
- 48dp minimum (Android guidelines)  
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Clear visual feedback on touch

### Gesture Support

- iPad (tablet baseline)
- Android phones (various sizes)
- Low-end devices for performance
- Community center displays

### Network Testing
- 2G/3G connection simulation
- Intermittent connectivity
- High latency scenarios
- Bandwidth limitations

## Implementation Guidelines

### CSS Framework
- Tailwind CSS with custom responsive utilities
