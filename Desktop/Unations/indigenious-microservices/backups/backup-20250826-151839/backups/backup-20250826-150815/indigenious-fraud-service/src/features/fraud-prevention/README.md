# Cross-Province Fraud Prevention System

## Overview
The Cross-Province Fraud Prevention System detects and prevents businesses from falsely claiming Indigenous status across different provinces. This protects legitimate Indigenous businesses and maintains the integrity of the platform.

## How It Works

### 1. **Multi-Layer Detection**
- **Name Variations**: Detects similar business names across provinces
- **Contact Matching**: Identifies reused emails, phones, addresses
- **Indigenous Claims**: Validates band numbers and nation affiliations
- **Velocity Checks**: Flags rapid registrations from same source
- **Network Analysis**: Links connections to banned accounts

### 2. **Risk Scoring**
- Each flag contributes to overall risk score (0-100)
- Severity levels: Warning (10pts), Alert (25pts), Critical (50pts)
- Risk levels: Low (<30), Medium (30-50), High (50-70), Critical (70+)

### 3. **Real-Time Analysis**
Every registration and update triggers:
```typescript
const assessment = await CrossProvinceFraudDetector.analyzeProfile({
  businessName: "Northern Enterprises",
  ownerName: "John Smith",
  email: "john@example.com",
  phone: "416-555-0123",
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Toronto",
    province: "ON",
    postalCode: "M5H 2N2"
  },
  indigenousAffiliation: {
    nation: "Six Nations",
    territory: "Grand River",
    bandNumber: "12345"
  }
});
```

## Fraud Patterns Detected

### 1. **Cross-Province Duplicates**
- Same business claiming different Indigenous affiliations
- Identical owner names with slight variations
- Reused band numbers across provinces

### 2. **Velocity Fraud**
- Multiple registrations from same IP address
- Rapid creation of similar businesses
- Burst patterns indicating automated fraud

### 3. **Identity Fraud**
- Disposable email addresses
- Mismatched phone area codes
- Virtual office addresses
- Invalid business numbers

### 4. **Network Fraud**
- Connections to previously banned accounts
- Shared bank accounts or tax IDs
- Links to high-risk businesses

## Critical Flags

These flags trigger immediate review:
- `duplicate_band_number`: Band number already registered
- `conflicting_nation_claims`: Same owner, different nations
- `banned_individual`: Connected to banned accounts
- `multiple_active_businesses`: Exceeds allowed limit

## Dashboard Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Live fraud alerts with risk scores
- Geographic fraud heat map
- Pattern analysis and trends
- Quick approve/reject actions

### Statistics Tracked
- Total assessments performed
- Flagged registrations today
- Critical alerts requiring action
- Prevented fraud attempts
- Common fraud patterns

## Integration Points

### 1. **Registration Flow**
```typescript
// During business registration
const fraudCheck = await CrossProvinceFraudDetector.analyzeProfile(formData);

if (fraudCheck.riskLevel === 'critical') {
  // Block registration, require manual review
  return { error: 'Registration requires manual verification' };
}

if (fraudCheck.requiresManualReview) {
  // Flag for review but allow provisional access
  await flagForReview(businessId, fraudCheck);
}
```

### 2. **Verification Process**
```typescript
// Enhanced verification for flagged accounts
if (business.fraudScore > 50) {
  requiredDocs.push('additionalProofOfIdentity');
  requiredDocs.push('videoVerification');
  requiredDocs.push('bandCouncilLetter');
}
```

### 3. **Payment System**
```typescript
// Block payments for high-risk accounts
if (business.fraudScore > 70) {
  throw new Error('Account under review - payments suspended');
}
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. **Deterrence**
- Clear warnings about fraud consequences
- Permanent bans for false claims
- Legal action threats displayed prominently

### 2. **Verification**
- Multi-factor authentication
- Document verification with AI
- Community validation requirements
- Video verification calls

### 3. **Monitoring**
- Continuous behavior analysis
- Transaction pattern monitoring
- Relationship network mapping
- Cross-reference with government databases
