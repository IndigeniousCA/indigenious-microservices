    const response = await fetch('/api/badges', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify({ businessId: 'test' })
    });
    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
  });
  
  it('should prevent SQL injection', async () => {
    const maliciousInput = "'; DROP TABLE badges; --";
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  it('should enforce rate limits', async () => {
    // Burst test implementation
  });
});
```
