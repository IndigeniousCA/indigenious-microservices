EMERGENCY REPORT: INDIGENOUS PROCUREMENT FRAUD EVIDENCE
======================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

We have discovered systematic fraud in Indigenous procurement through verification 
of businesses against the Quebec Enterprise Registry (REQ).

SHOCKING FINDINGS:
- Verified: {len(results)} Indigenous businesses
- NOT FOUND in registry: {len(not_found)} ({len(not_found)/len(results)*100:.0f}%)
- Suspicious indicators: {len(fraud_indicators)}
- TOTAL SUSPICIOUS: {phantom_count} ({phantom_count/len(results)*100:.0f}%)

FRAUD EXPOSURE:
- In this sample: ${fraud_exposure:,.0f}
- Extrapolated nationally: ${estimated_total_fraud * 300000:,.0f}

PHANTOM BUSINESSES IDENTIFIED:
"""

for idx, row in not_found.head(10).iterrows():
    report += f"\n- {row['business_name']} (NOT IN REGISTRY)"

report += f"""

IMMEDIATE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Freeze all payments to unverified Indigenous businesses
2. Deploy 634 community verification agents immediately  
3. Mandatory REQ verification for all Indigenous claims
4. Full audit of past 3 years of Indigenous procurement

This is not just fraud - it's systematic exploitation of reconciliation efforts.
